# blog-app
This is a blog project that allows users to write on any topic of interest

This project was to apply the concepts I learnt in backend web development 

Users need to register and authenticate themselves before they can create a post

On the app, authenticated users can like posts, create, view, edit and delete posts they created

Users of posts can delete comments they find hurtful and creators of comments also have the option to delete in realtime
